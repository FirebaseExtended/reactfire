# Documentation | ReactFire

[ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a framework for building large, complex user
interfaces. Firebase complements it perfectly by providing an easy-to-use, realtime data source for
populating the state of React components. With ReactFire it only takes a few lines of JavaScript to
integrate Firebase into React apps.
