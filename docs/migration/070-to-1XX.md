# Migrating from ReactFire `0.7.0` to `1.x.x`

This migration document covers all the major breaking changes mentioned in the [ReactFire `1.0.0`
change log](https://github.com/firebase/reactfire/releases/tag/v1.0.0).


## Upgrade your Firebase SDK

While ReactFire `1.0.0` continues to support all `2.x.x` versions of the Firebase SDK, we encourage
you to upgrade to version `3.x.x`. See the [Firebase `3.x.x` migration
guide](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/firebase-web) for more details.
