## Description

This example shows three different ways to make a Todo app using React. It is adapted from the Todo
app example on the [ReactJS homepage](http://facebook.github.io/react/). There are three different
versions of the Todo app example:

1. __Plain React:__ Almost an exact copy of the ReactJS homepage example. This uses plain React
code with no Firebase code at all. Changes made to this example are not persistent.

2. __React + Plain Firebase:__ A version of the first example with explicit Firebase calls. Changes
made to this example are persistent.

3. __ReactFire:__ A version of the first example which uses ReactFire. Changes made to this example
are persistent.
